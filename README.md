# Interview Trainer Agent – Capstone Project

The Interview Trainer Agent is an AI-powered tool designed to help users prepare for job interviews by generating personalized question sets, answer strategies, and improvement tips. It is built using IBM Watsonx.ai and the Granite-3-3-8B foundation model. The tool tailors interview preparation based on the user’s job role and experience level.

## Key Features
- Generates role-specific interview questions, covering both technical and behavioral aspects
- Provides answer tips and improvement suggestions to help refine responses
- Uses prompt engineering to customize questions for fresher and experienced candidates
- Requires no programming knowledge, as it is built entirely on IBM Watsonx.ai Prompt Lab
- Runs on a cloud-based setup for scalability

## System Approach
1. The user enters their job role and experience level.
2. Prompts are created and sent to the Granite-3-3-8B model for human-like question generation.
3. The system returns targeted interview questions, example answers, and preparation tips.
4. The process can be refined based on user feedback to improve accuracy.
